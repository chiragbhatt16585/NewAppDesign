# Simple Token Regeneration Fix

## Problem Solved
The app was failing to automatically regenerate authentication tokens when they expired, causing users to be logged out and see blank data.

## Root Cause
The token regeneration was attempting to authenticate without stored credentials, causing authentication failures.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Credential Storage**
- Added proper credential retrieval during token regeneration
- Improved logging to track credential availability
- Fixed credential storage and retrieval process

### 2. **Improved Token Regeneration**
- Token regeneration now uses stored username and password
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Implemented safeguards against infinite loops (max 2 attempts)
- Added proper authentication parameters (OTP, phone_no, user_type)

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Clear error messages for different failure scenarios
- Graceful fallbacks when credentials are missing
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

## Key Changes Made

### `src/services/api.ts`
- Added credential storage import
- Enhanced `performTokenRegeneration()` to use stored credentials
- Improved `regenerateToken()` with better logging
- Added safeguards in `makeAuthenticatedRequest()` to prevent infinite loops
- Fixed `authUser()` method signature

### `src/services/credentialStorage.ts`
- Enhanced logging to track credential availability
- Better error handling for missing credentials

## How It Works Now

1. **During Login**: Credentials are stored securely in AsyncStorage
2. **Token Expiration**: When a token expires, the system detects it
3. **Credential Retrieval**: Stored username and password are retrieved
4. **Token Regeneration**: New authentication request is made with stored credentials
5. **Session Update**: New token is stored and session is updated
6. **Request Retry**: Original request is retried with the new token

## Testing

You can test the token regeneration by:

1. **Login to the app** with valid credentials
2. **Wait for token to expire** or manually trigger token regeneration
3. **Check console logs** for token regeneration messages
4. **Verify data loads** without manual login

## Console Logs to Watch

Look for these log messages to verify the fix is working:

```
[ApiService] Token expired, attempting to regenerate...
[ApiService] Attempting token regeneration for user: [username]
[ApiService] Token regeneration successful
[ApiService] Token regenerated successfully, retrying request...
```

## Result
- ✅ **Automatic token regeneration** when tokens expire
- ✅ **No more blank screens** due to authentication failures
- ✅ **Users stay logged in** without manual intervention
- ✅ **Proper error handling** with clear messages
- ✅ **No infinite loops** or repeated logout attempts

The app will now automatically handle token expiration and regenerate tokens seamlessly in the background.
