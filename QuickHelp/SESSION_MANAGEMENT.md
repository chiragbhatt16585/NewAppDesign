# Session Management

## Overview

The app now implements persistent login sessions that remain active until the user explicitly logs out. This provides a better user experience by eliminating automatic logout due to inactivity.

## Session Management Features

### Persistent Login (Enabled)
- Sessions persist indefinitely until manual logout
- No automatic logout due to inactivity
- Users remain logged in across app restarts

### Session Validation
- Enhanced session validation before API calls
- Automatic token regeneration when needed
- Graceful handling of missing tokens without clearing sessions

### Session Monitoring (Disabled)
- Session monitoring has been completely disabled
- No automatic inactivity warnings or logout prompts
- Sessions persist indefinitely until manual logout

### Debug Features
- Session debug tests added to help troubleshoot issues
- Session persistence tests to verify functionality
- Enhanced logging for session state tracking

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Session Manager Updates
- Removed automatic session expiry logic
- Modified `getCurrentSession()` to return session if it exists (no strict validation)
- Updated `checkSessionBeforeApiCall()` to not clear sessions for missing tokens
- Removed session expiry from token regeneration

### 2. Session Validation Hook
- Updated to not show alerts for missing tokens
- Allows API calls to handle token regeneration
- Only shows alerts for complete session loss

### 3. Screen Updates
- Modified HomeScreen, SessionsScreen, LedgerScreen to continue API calls even if session validation fails
- Let API handle token regeneration instead of blocking calls

### 4. AuthContext Updates
- Disabled session monitoring completely
- Removed automatic session clearing
- Sessions persist until manual logout

### 5. Debug Tools
- Added `sessionDebugTest.ts` for comprehensive session debugging
- Added `sessionTest.ts` for persistence testing
- Enhanced logging throughout session management

## Troubleshooting

### If sessions are still being cleared:
1. Check if sessionMonitor is still running (should be disabled)
2. Verify AuthContext is not starting session monitoring
3. Check API calls for session clearing logic
4. Run debug tests to identify the source

### If data is not loading:
1. Check session validation logs
2. Verify token regeneration is working
3. Check API responses for authentication errors
4. Use debug tests to verify session state

## Testing

Run the app and check the console for:
- Session debug output
- Session persistence test results
- Session validation results

The app should now maintain login sessions indefinitely until manual logout.
